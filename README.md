## Overview

This project dives into a comprehensive analysis of consumer complaints, leveraging a rich dataset from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that includes over 2.3 million records. By studying narratives and metadata across various categories, the project aims to extract insights on complaint trends, geographical patterns, and the effectiveness of complaint resolutions. Through this analysis, we aim to highlight improvement areas for enhanced customer satisfaction within the financial sector.

## Core Objectives üéØ

1. **Insights for Internal Optimization**  
   - Pinpoint sources of complaints and route insights to relevant teams to help reduce complaint volume.
   - Evaluate the sentiment tied to complaint types, which enables prioritization of high-impact issues.

2. **Identifying Common Themes**  
   - Apply topic modelling to detect and track recurring themes, with a focus on emerging consumer issues.

3. **Understanding Text Complexity and Outcomes**  
   - Analyze the readability of complaint narratives to explore its relationship with the likelihood of resolution.

4. **Geographical Patterns**  
   - Segment complaint data by region to uncover location-based trends and unique issues faced by consumers in different areas.

5. **Predictive Analysis**  
   - Build predictive models to forecast resolution outcomes based on complaint narratives and metadata.

6. **Benchmarking for Comparison**  
   - Compare complaint handling across companies and product types, identifying those associated with the highest dissatisfaction rates.

## Key Project Phases üß©

- **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
  - Merge datasets, handle missing values, and perform data balancing.
  - Generate relevant features to maximize the dataset's analytical potential.

- **Root Cause & Sentiment Analysis**
  - Investigate major complaint drivers and map them to sentiment scores for effective prioritization.

- **Topic Modelling and Readability Insights**
  - Apply NLP techniques to uncover common complaint themes and evaluate text complexity.

- **Geographic Insights**
  - Use regional segmentation to spotlight geographical trends and unique consumer challenges.

- **Predictive Modelling**
  - Build and train models to predict likely complaint outcomes or company response strategies.

- **Evaluation and Comparison**
  - Conduct comparative analyses on how companies and product types perform in terms of complaint handling and consumer satisfaction.

- **Deployment and Future Enhancements**
  - Deploy the model via Flask and plan future improvements, such as more advanced NLP techniques and multilingual capabilities.
