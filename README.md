## Overview

This project dives into a comprehensive analysis of consumer complaints, leveraging a rich dataset from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that includes over 2.3 million records. By studying narratives and metadata across various categories, the project aims to extract insights on complaint trends, geographical patterns, and the effectiveness of complaint resolutions. Through this analysis, we aim to highlight improvement areas for enhanced customer satisfaction within the financial sector.

## Core Objectives üéØ

1. **Insights for Internal Optimization**  
   - Pinpoint sources of complaints and route insights to relevant teams to help reduce complaint volume.
   - Evaluate the sentiment tied to complaint types, which enables prioritization of high-impact issues.

2. **Identifying Common Themes**  
   - Apply topic modelling to detect and track recurring themes, with a focus on emerging consumer issues.

3. **Understanding Text Complexity and Outcomes**  
   - Analyze the readability of complaint narratives to explore its relationship with the likelihood of resolution.

4. **Geographical Patterns**  
   - Segment complaint data by region to uncover location-based trends and unique issues faced by consumers in different areas.

5. **Predictive Analysis**  
   - Build predictive models to forecast resolution outcomes based on complaint narratives and metadata.

6. **Benchmarking for Comparison**  
   - Compare complaint handling across companies and product types, identifying those associated with the highest dissatisfaction rates.
